# UI Library

This project demonstrates a simple UI library implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes components like tooltips, dropdowns, tabs, and a snackbar for user interaction.

## Features

### Tooltips

Tooltips provide additional context and improve user experience by displaying helpful messages when hovering over elements.

### Dropdowns

Dropdowns allow users to interact with selectable options, such as T-shirt designs and sticker printing services.

### Tabs

Tabs organize content into different sections (About Us, Delivery Information, Returns Information) for easy navigation and information access.

### Snackbar

The snackbar component displays temporary messages at the top of the screen, notifying users about actions or events.
